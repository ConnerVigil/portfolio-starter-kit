# Projects

## Proxy Server

- Built an HTTP proxy server using a threadpool to handle multiple concurrent requests
- Then rebuilt it using epoll and I/O multiplexing to handle multiple concurrent requests to demonstrate the performance difference between the two
- Learned concepts related to networking, concurrency, sockets, signals, processes, and threads
- Part of a Systems Programming University course

## Traveling Salesman Problem

- Solved the traveling salesman problem using the following algorithms: branch and bound, greedy, and nearest insertion
- Implemented in Python

## Gene Sequence Alignment

- Implemented dynamic programming algorithm for computing the minimal cost of aligning gene sequences and for extracting optimal alignments
- Implemented in Python

## Networking Routing

- Implemented Dyskstra’s algorithm to find paths through a graph representing a network routing problem. Used two different data structures to implement a priority queue in order to see that both algorithm design and data structure implementation significantly affect performance
- Implemented in Python

## Convex Hull

- Implemented a divide and conquer algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points and analyzed the algorithm both theoretically and empirically
- Implemented in Python

## Sandbox 2022 Hackathon

- Created the frontend of a universal flight platform “OnTheFly” mobile app with navigation capabilities
- Built using React Native and other React Native libraries

## Rate Everything App (BYU Dev Club)

- A social media app that allows users to answer and rate daily prompts, and view other users’ responses
- Built with Flutter, Firebase, and Typescript
- Worked on the backend, including the database, and API

## Family Map Server & Client

- A Java server and Android client that allows users to view their family history
- Created an http request server to implement a web API and interact with a MySQL database
- Developed a Java android client application to accompany the server to call it’s API and display family history data for the user
- Part of an Advanced Programming University course

## BYU Free Food App (BYU Dev Club)

- React Native app to help hungry students find free food on campus
- Worked on the map view with React-Native-Maps

## Datalog Interpreter

- An interpreter program for the Datalog language, built as part of a Discrete Mathematics University course
- Built in 4,000+ lines of code written in C++
- Consists of a Scanner, Parser, Relational Database, and Interpreter
